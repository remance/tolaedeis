3,"Amunsa",1400,31,6,1,1,8,2,,3,0,1,"It is often said that creation represents the personality of the creator. The weapons that Amunsa created were all in the hand of the greatest warriors and rulers in written history. The perfection of quality comes not only from pure talent but also thousand hours of hard-working practice. His arts were even praised by the dwarf craftsmen, something that no human ever have the grace to ever receive it. "
4,"Jonas Elbadai",1000,86,4,8,3,4,7,14,4,,1,"The world is not only made of black and white. It existed in many shades of colour, maybe even the colours we can never see. So does a person and his or her characteristics. But must so-called characteristic be constant? What would happen if a person can change his personality in the matter of friction of a second? Not simply faking it but completely alters it at the very core to become a completely new identity. Can such a thing even be called person anymore or it becomes something incomprehensible entirely? "

His single-mindedness is very troublesome for many people involved in his life. Now a king of Masendor, the hero of Meskemdar, the first of house Karsunlaamt. His rule will certainly bring change to the history of the whole world."

He does not take kindly to deception and will swiftly cut down anyone whom he thinks has wronged him. Despite being a warrior, Orsanoas does not flavour wearing any armour of sort. His favourite weapon seems to be a giant swordstaff named ""Aetel""."

Rodhinbar hardly ever left his village due to being far from the country's border and warzone. Such peace means that he had not fully utilised his skill and seen the horror of war.  "

Despite his talent and ingenious rulership, he just simply cannot overcome his extraordinarily bad luck. His country will fall to ruin no matter what he accomplishes as he can only delay the inevitable and he himself aware of such fact.

Adaqua has a natural talent with the way of mobile archery, a gift that unfortunately has never been recognised. Her bandit gang is well-known for ambush tactics against patrols and merchant caravans with a perfect success record. However, soon the future will come when mere survival with a life of banditry will no longer be enough. Will a close-knitted group of savages be able to settle into a sustainable community? Or will they roam the earth until their descendants are wiped out by the ever-growing civilise military forces?  "

Rumour is that this creature once was seen talking to another similar female creature or even travelling together. Nobody knows where they came from or why they stalked the forest, but the first sighting was around 20 years ago by the hunter whose arm got chopped off."

Her ability to channel the magic is far above even some of the most powerful wizards. Although lacking in combat and leadership proficiency, her role as the Holy Maiden and the belief that she will protect the country from all evils make her authority reaching to the point of worshipping."
